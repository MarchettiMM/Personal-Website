# Personal Website
 Repository of a personal website project to start studies with web development.

Website created in HTML5 and CSS to improve knowledge of the fundamentals of these languages.

This site currently contains a single page with the basic tags in both languages, which will later be changed to match the look and feel of the personal site.
